# Viassimp

A 3D model viewer for Open Asset Import Library [assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) supporting all the [3D formats](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/blob/master/doc/Fileformats.md) it supports (glTF, FBX, Obj and COLLADA etc)

# Why another viewer

Assimp is amazing but I couldn't find a viewer that is cross platform and updated in the last year. This is an attempt to create a modern viewer using modern APIs working on most of assimp's supported platforms
